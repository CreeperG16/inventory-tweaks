# inventory-tweaks
An Onix Client script which adds a few nice tweaks for using your inventory, such as shulker display, which allows you to see the full contents of shulker boxes without placing the box down; and some miscellaneous tweaks to allow you to shift+click items into crafting tables and drag your mouse over multiple slots while holding shift.

# Shulker Display
## See everything
You can now see **all** the items contained in any shulker box, without having to place it down, or even take it out of your enderchest.

## A world of colour
Colour-code your boxes? The GUI can follow the colour scheme of your items.

## Just a few items
Want to know exactly how much you have of each item in total? Hold a predefined key to see the condensed view, or even switch it to the default view.

# Misc tweaks
## Shift Click Crafting
Shift+click items from your inventory into the crafting table. This feature was added to vanilla Java edition in 1.15.

## Drag Over Items
Hold shift and left click, and drag your mouse over multiple slots to move all of them into or out of containers much faster.
Drag your mouse over multiple slots while holding your drop key to drop all items from those slots.

## Scroll Items
Scroll downwards on a slot to fine-tune how many items to move from that slot.

## How do I get it?
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/CreeperG16/inventory-tweaks/releases) page to download the latest version of the script, or get it from other sources such as the Onix Client Scripts [github repo](https://github.com/OnixClient-Scripts/OnixClient_Scripts).
- **Disclaimer**: The source code on the repository **won't work** with onix client as is!

### Building it yourself
Currently the helper program I made to organise and build my scripts is private. (It's really simple though - it just replaces 'require "filepath"' with an iife containing the code in that file, among other nice qol stuff) You can manually copy and paste the different files into the right places yourself though, were you really determined not to use the download link on the latest release - you do you.
